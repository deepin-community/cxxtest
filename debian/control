Description: lightweight xUnit-like framework for C/C++ applications
 CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to
 JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit. It provides assertions for checking conditions
 and classes for defining unit-test cases.
 .
 CxxTest is easy to use because it does not require precompiling a CxxTest
 testing library, it employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it
 supports a very flexible form of test discovery, which simplifies the creation
 of test drivers. It includes a script that parses C++ files that define unit
 tests and then generates a C++ test runner. When compiled, the test runner
 manages the execution of all unit tests in a flexible manner.
