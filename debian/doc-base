Title: CxxTest User Guide
Author: William Hart, Gasper Azman, Kevin Fitch, John Siirola
Abstract: This manual describes the design and usage of CxxTest version 4.
 CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to
 JUnit <https://junit.org/>, CppUnit <https://cppunit.sourceforge.net> and
 xUnit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit>. CxxTest is easy to
 use because it does not require precompiling a CxxTest testing
 library, it employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it
 supports a very flexible form of test discovery.  This documentation
 describes CxxTest 4.1, which includes significant enhancements to
 the test discovery process, a modern test driver, and new documentation.
